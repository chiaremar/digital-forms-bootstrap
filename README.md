The UI is a mobile-first responsive grid layout. Click in the Type and Gross Weight fields to change skid data.  
The Type fields pops up a selection list of electronics types in a modal. The Gross Weight field exposes a custom numberpad for the input field. The input field is still active when the numberpad is displayed so both controls can be used to enter the gross weight. Hit the checkmark on the numberpad when finished entering the gross weight for the skid.
